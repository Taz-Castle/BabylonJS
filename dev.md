# Element 5 Documentation

Element 5 features 2 scenes that can be swapped between using buttons implemented through GUI. The fifth element gives the biggest chance to be creative, so for my fifth element, I reused previous elements and combined elements from other scenes to make my own.

Scene 1: Scene 1 is a simple scene that consists of 2 shapes, 1 large sphere floating in the middle above a flat plane. Above the sphere is a cube that floats directly above it.


Scene 2: Scene 2 uses a combination of implementing different shapes, colours, textures and rotation. In the scene you can see 4 dark blue cones that sit on a flat plane that is Orange. In the centre of this plane floating above is a sphere with a lava texture that has been applied to it and directly above that is a diamond shape that rotates continously round and round with a wooden texture applied to it.
